# Rock, Paper, Scissors! ü™®üßª‚úÇÔ∏è

This is the third "The Odin Project" exercise.

It definetely was a bump up from what I was used to coding, but was lots of fun to learn.

Got hit by many walls, plenty of time doing research, polishing things I've learnt, and applying things I had to learn on the go.

The first real code with JavaScript, which allowed me to implement lots of interactive code with the page.

Used plenty of selfmade functions, a lot of querySelector(), getElementById(), and many more were needed.

Practiced the ability to change the DOM tree using JavaScript.

Here is a preview of the page:

In this project, the goal is to play the well-known rock, paper, scissors game. With the help of built-in buttons, displaying images to show your options, you will try to beat the machine, that will also be choosing between rock, paper or scissors.
The first to 5 is the winner, and when one of the two reach the goal, a button to play again appears.
